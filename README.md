# The Hive
(This is a sample README based on a 2017-2018 project which is described [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IEg6mPC_QWvWVlcaovjPBC3xovZGu4Lv01wZbglIj9M/edit#slide=id.g51ee624732_0_151))

# Our Partner Organization
Impact Experience aims to build bridges between investors, foundations, entrepreneurs, and local leaders to co-fund and co-develop impactful solutions to the problems of marginalized communities. Each Impact Experience typically includes 20 to 30 participants and lasts between one and a half to three days. To more intimately understand the challenges communities are facing, the expertly-facilitated process includes site visits and conversations with local leaders.

# The Challenge
Conversations created at Impact Experience conferences need a platform to remain relevant. After the initial interest, communities lack the ability to follow-up on commitments.

# Our solution
After engaging in needfinding with partner org and community stakeholders, we arrived at the following solution. To maintain engagement with a new platform, we need to create a niche forum for social impact discussions. The forum will:
* Engage users in relevant blog content
* Update community on completed commitments from Impact Experience events
* Connect alumni, investors, and staff
